# DevDash

## Description
This small project's intent was to practice making API calls to GitHub's GraphQL schema in order to obtain my user, repository, and commit data. This project was inspired by Tamino Martinius and his contributions dashboard. The project can grow in many different directions, and I'm not sure where it'll lead, but I'm having fun doing it. Check it out on GitHub Pages!

## Languages
This is build using the React.JS framework and Sass for styling.
